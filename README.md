# bluetooth_in_flutter

In this lab, you will use a third-party Bluetooth package to create a Flutter app that can connect to external bluetooth devices.  This app will display the list of nearby available devices and the information those devices publish to the world, i.e. their "characteristics."  This app will be useful for future efforts in the class, as later we will be developing an external Bluetooth device using the Raspberry PI and components you bought earlier in the class. Now is a good time to remind you that you will need those soon - so if you haven't bought them, do so now.
